Based on the user feedback and the current application plan, the following files are most likely to need updates to address the feedback:

<relevant_files>
<file>app/routes/auth.py</file>
<file>app/routes/admin.py</file>
<file>main.py</file>
<file>app/__init__.py</file>
</relevant_files>

Explanation:
1. app/routes/auth.py: This file handles authentication routes, including /register and /login. It needs to be updated to return JSON responses for these routes.

2. app/routes/admin.py: This file contains the admin panel routes. It needs to be modified to return the admin login template and handle the /admin route correctly.

3. main.py: This file is the entry point of the application and may need adjustments to ensure proper routing and JSON responses.

4. app/__init__.py: This file initializes the Flask application and its extensions. It might need updates to ensure proper configuration for JSON responses and route handling.

These files are the most likely candidates for modification to address the user feedback regarding JSON responses for /register and /login routes, as well as the admin login template and /admin route handling.
