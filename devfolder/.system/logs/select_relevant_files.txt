Based on the user feedback, which indicates runtime errors and possible issues with the Flask application startup, the following files are most likely to need updates:

<relevant_files>
<file>app/__init__.py</file>
<file>config.py</file>
<file>main.py</file>
<file>app/services/__init__.py</file>
<file>app/utils/error_handler.py</file>
<file>app/routes/__init__.py</file>
<file>app/services/logging_service.py</file>
</relevant_files>

The app/__init__.py file is crucial as it initializes the Flask application and its extensions. The config.py file may need adjustments to ensure proper configuration settings. The main.py file is the entry point of the application and might require modifications to address startup issues. The app/services/__init__.py file initializes various services and could be related to the startup process. The app/utils/error_handler.py file is responsible for error handling and logging, which could help address the runtime errors. The app/routes/__init__.py file defines Flask routes and could be related to the application startup. Lastly, the app/services/logging_service.py file handles logging and could be useful in diagnosing and fixing the reported issues.
