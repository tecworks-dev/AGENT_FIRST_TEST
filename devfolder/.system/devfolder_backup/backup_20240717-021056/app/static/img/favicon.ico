# This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.
# In a real application, this would be a binary file containing the favicon image.
# For the purposes of this code generation task, we'll leave this as a comment.

# Typically, a favicon.ico file is a small icon (usually 16x16, 32x32, or 64x64 pixels)
# that represents your website or application in the browser's address bar, 
# bookmarks, and tabs.

# To create a proper favicon:
# 1. Design your icon using an image editing tool.
# 2. Save it in .ico format.
# 3. Replace this placeholder with the actual .ico file.
# 4. Ensure the file is named 'favicon.ico' and placed in the 'app/static/img/' directory.

# Remember to link to your favicon in your HTML templates:
# <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/favicon.ico') }}">
