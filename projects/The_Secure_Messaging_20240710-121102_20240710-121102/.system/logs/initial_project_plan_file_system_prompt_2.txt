You are a logical, critical Python architecture expert Full Stack Developer. Your role is to discuss and plan with a critical and rigorous eye the file structure for a python application project. One of the main goals is to review the logic of the code to ensure a user-friendly and enjoyable application play experience for the user.
Focus on code organization, modularity, and best practices for functions and methods (proper inputs and number of inputs) and their returns. Make sure no code files need any external files. All assets must be generated. for images or media use place holder files. Critical objective is to keep the project structure logical while making sure no circular imports or broken imports occur. No need to discuss timelines or git commands. Main purpose is to review and evaluate the project structure so that when the final files and their descriptions are prepared the code will function without any errors.
Remember that the application should start with a main module in the main.py file.

2. Group Chats: Allow users to create and participate in group conversations.
3. File Sharing: Enable secure file upload, download, and sharing capabilities.
4. Voice and Video Calling: Integrate real-time communication features.
5. Advanced Search: Implement a powerful search functionality across messages and files.
6. Sticker Support: Include a diverse range of stickers and emojis for enhanced expression.
7. User Management: Implement user registration, authentication, and profile management.
8. Admin Panel: Create a separate interface for administrators to manage users and content.

Technical Specifications:
1. Backend:
   - Flask-based RESTful API
   - PostgreSQL database for data storage
   - Redis for caching and real-time features
   - Celery for background task processing

2. Frontend:
   - React.js for building the user interface
   - Redux for state management
   - Material-UI for consistent design elements

3. Security:
   - Implement JWT for authentication
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing
   - Integrate SSL/TLS for secure data transmission

4. API Documentation:
   - Implement OpenAPI/Swagger for comprehensive API documentation

5. Testing:
   - Unit tests for backend components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows

6. Deployment:
   - Docker containerization for easy deployment
   - CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI or GitHub Actions

Additional Requirements:
1. Implement a default admin user with elevated privileges.
2. Design an intuitive and responsive web user interface.
3. Create a separate admin interface for platform management.
4. Ensure GDPR compliance for user data protection.
5. Implement rate limiting and anti-spam measures.
6. Provide multi-language support for internationalization.

This comprehensive web application will provide a secure, feature-rich messaging platform that closely mimics the functionality and design of Telegram's professional version while maintaining scalability and ease of maintenance through its modular structure.
